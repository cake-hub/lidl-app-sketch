# Setup

How you get access to all our fine CAKE products.

---

## Introduction

- CAKE is now available on GitHub.
- Our recommendation is to use an external software to get access to our design system library files (e.g. Sourcetree)
- The **CAKE UI Fundamental** repository is the global library file you need to work with any other CAKE UI product (e.g. App, Chatbot, Web, Mail,… )
