A grid system can be use to align and size objects within a given format.

## Usage

- The amount, width and spacing of the columns change with the breakpoint.
- The mobile development can independently use its preferred grid system.

|---|---|---|
| Content is placed in the areas of the screen that contain columns.<br>The number of columns displayed is determined by the selected device. | Gutters are the spaces between columns.<br> They help separate contents. | Margins are the space between content and the left and right edges of the screen. |
